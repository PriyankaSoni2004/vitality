### Problem statement: Sentiment Analysis of Incoming calls on helpdesk

**Solution/ Approach:**
Weâ€™re looking for a solution by creating a software that will serve as a platform for individuals, helpdesk, call centers, or organizations to get a sentimental analysis of calls. The prototype function will follow as follows:

- Users can choose to log in as guests, allowing them to upload individual call files for analysis. Alternatively, organizations can log in and provide their large call database for comprehensive sentiment analysis. This dual-login approach ensures flexibility in accessing and analyzing call data.

- Once the data is acquired, it will be transferred to the Machine Learning Model using a Flask API.

- The model would first pre-process the data, in which all the unnecessary noises would be removed. The pre-processed data would then be sent forward for testing and analysis.

- The software classifies each audio into one of eight sentiments and presents the results to users. For guest users, we provide the sentiment directly, while for database users, we offer a comprehensive dashboard with sentiment analysis presented through various visualizations.
